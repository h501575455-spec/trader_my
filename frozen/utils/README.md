# Autotune

It is important to emphasize that parameter tuning is highly susceptible to overfitting when conducted without proper constraints. To ensure robustness and mitigate overfitting risks, rigorous out-of-sample validation protocols must be implemented throughout the optimization process.

Reasonable restrictions reduce the feasible domain of parameters and lower the risk of overfitting. For example, if the restrictions are based on prior knowledge and practical experience (such as trading cost constraints and volatility constraints), these restrictions actually help the strategy avoid overfitting.

If the restrictions are imposed to forcefully improve the strategy's performance on historical data (such as selecting optimal parameters for specific time periods only), such restrictions will increase the risk of overfitting.

This hierarchical optimization framework ensures both signal quality at the factor level and robust performance at the strategy implementation level, while maintaining practical trading constraints and efficiency considerations.
